<p><span class="bigger">I stepped into a studio for the first time at age 14</span> as a drummer with a small local band. The booth they had me in was claustrophobically small. The studio owner declared sternly over the talkback how we were to start the first song, which wasn't the way we practiced it. The situation was awkward and disconcerting. That impressed upon me firsthand the importance of making musicians feel comfortable in a recording session.</p> 

<p>Throughout my teens I honed my sense of musical balance by recording with one or two mics at a time on my 4-track, adjusting the sound in the room rather than manipulating it after the mic. I became endlessly fascinated with how recording embodied the intersection of art and science; I came to appreciate the nuances that occur in the manifestation of the abstract in the tangible. I determined while still a teen that I'd rather record than perform.</p> 

<p>I went to recording school, learned how to run 24-track 2" tape machines with large analog consoles, and gallivanted around the country. I eventually ended up at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Recording_Company">Chicago Recording Company</a> where I worked with all kinds of artists from Kanye West to Patricia Barber to the Red Hot Chili Peppers. I ran the Pro Tools system with a room full of 20 <a href="http://cso.org/">CSO</a> players. I ended up hanging out in the vocal booth with Timbaland as he laid down a loop. I worked on Latin music, gospel music, jazz, hip hop, rock, classical, and everything in between.</p> 

<p>Musicians started asking me to help them out at their home studios; I learned to adapt to less controlled situations. I started recording classical recitals at university halls, tuning my ears to more spaces. Eventually I made a couple of acoustic albums in home settings that made me realize we didn't need a recording studio at all. That epiphany started a trend.</p> 

<p>Today, I bring all this experience together to form a wide palette of approaches to recording while continuing to explore new ways to make ideas happen.</p>
