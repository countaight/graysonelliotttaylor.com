            		<div class="clearleft"><p>Rather than use the same setups in the same rooms by default (which is unfortunately often the case at many recording facilities, where the staff has microphones set up before even meeting the artist), I creatively take advantage of the full range of options for recording spaces. Just as an orchestra sounds great in a big hall, so can a jazz band or a rock band. Many non-traditional spaces sound very good and have their own unique character you can't replicate in more controlled environments.
</p><p>
I strive to capture recordings that are three-dimensional, with front-to-back depth as well as left-to-right width. Microphone technique, along with choosing the right space, is key to this. I often don't even need any digital reverb, although I have plenty to choose from. 
</p><p>
Chicago has a lot of great options for studios; that environment remains the best choice for a lot of projects. However, sometimes you need a bigger natural ambience to perform with. Or maybe you'll feel more relaxed in a less formal environment with everyone in the same room where you can take breaks without worrying about the hourly studio rate. Or maybe you just don't need a whole big multi-room studio for your one-person folk project. Whatever the case, I like to get to know the artist and their music so we can best decide what's right for them.</p>

            		<h2><a id="mixing">MIXING</a></h2>
           		<p>I have my own mixing/mastering studio in the historic <a href="http://www.fineartsbuilding.com/">Fine Arts Building</a>. Since I record elsewhere, my space is optimized for accurate listening. Having my space set up as a mastering studio allows me to better aim for the final result when mixing. It's also an inspiring space to be in, being the oldest arts building in the country and just a short walk from the Art Institute where I take coffee breaks.</p>

         		<p>Honing my chops fixing up a few years of national archives for <a href="http://www.oyez.org/">Oyez.org</a>, I am an expert in audio repair. Recent technological advances offer unprecedented ability to repair audio after it's recorded. Background air conditioning hum can be reduced, traffic noise can be removed, even cell phone rings and coughs can be taken out of live recordings as if they never happened. Audio examples below:
